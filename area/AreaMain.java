//Sub Class Constructor implicitly calls Super Class Default Constructor(Always).  

//Abstract class is an incomplete class that cannot be instantiated and is used as a base for other classes.
//it cannot have a reference variable of its own type but can have reference variables of its subclass types.
//interfaces are incomplete classes that cannot be instantiated and are used to define a contract for classes that implement them. 
//they are developed to get in the sub class and take reference of the sub class and call the method of the sub class.
//abstract class object only can be declared but cannot be instantiated. It can have reference variable of its own type but cannot create object of its own type. 
//if you have any abstract method in the class then the class must be declared as abstract class.
//but if a class if a abstract class then it is not necessary that it should have abstract method.
